        <AboutText>
          Hello! I'm Benedicte, a passionate front-end developer based in France
          and wishing to explore the world. With a keen eye for design and a
          deep understanding of user experience, I specialize in crafting
          visually stunning and intuitive web applications. My journey in web
          development began with a fascination for how things work behind the
          scenes, and it has evolved into a commitment to creating seamless,
          engaging digital experiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          I excel in transforming creative ideas into functional realities,
          leveraging modern technologies like React, Typescript, and CSS
          frameworks to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces. I believe
          that code is not just a set of instructions but a means of bringing
          ideas to life. My work reflects not only my technical expertise but
          also my dedication to continuous learning and adaptation in this
          ever-evolving field.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond my technical skills, I pride myself on being a collaborative
          team player who values open communication and constructive feedback. I
          thrive in environments where creativity flourishes, and I'm always
          eager to share knowledge and support others in their journey. As you
          explore my portfolio, you'll find a showcase of my projects that
          highlight my ability to blend functionality with aesthetics. Whether
          you're looking for a sleek landing page or a complex web application,
          I'm here to bring your vision to life.
          <br />
          <br />
          Letâ€™s create something amazing together!
